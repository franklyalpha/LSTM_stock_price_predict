Standardization:
    stock price and daily average requires standardization, so does MACD;
    WR currently doesn't require standardization, but should consider whether the whole column should
    divide by 100.
    when standardizing, should we only standardize for each sample? (because it might not make sense to
    standardize all period of data using the same criterion, as the "graph" is required, for analyzing intensity)

    day_price standardization:
    take the highest and lowest price "among" high, low, close and all daily average line,
    and then take the difference of high and low as denominator for standardization;
    (after this step, all data points are no different by 1;)
    finally need to shift all data into the interval [0, 1].

    MACD standardization:
    Similar technique as standardizing day_price;
    the high and low are gathered "among" MACD_line and MACD_signal (as these two lines are present on the
    same screen, sharing same criterion;)
    also the range of data should be placed between [-1, 1] -> the data standardization should pay attention to
    consistency of "zero" line.
    MACD_hist might require re-calculation.

target:
    Currently the model is still designed to be supervised; thus need to provide the target.
    One idea came into the mind of us is, to predict the result of stock after 5 periods, 10 periods, 20 periods,
    40 periods and use these information as a decision for whether to enter or quit the stock.
    However this might lead to same long-term problems faced by most stock prediction models.
    Therefore to better generalize, the target value should be loosen; instead of predicting the exact values,
    what we need is just whether the price will be higher than current buying price.
    the 10-20-40 helps generating an estimated graph, which can support up to at most one transactions per week.

    The final result still require further consideration, but this simplification at least helps generating target values
    much easier.

    to see whether other alternative target values are available, should consult with your father and some data if
    required.

    realizing that sometimes long-term tendency can be an effective criterion for long-term prediction (60-period line,
    etc.)
